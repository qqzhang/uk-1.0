Quick start
===========
Install Longene, you have only 2 steps to go:
1. Build Wine, without wineserver
2. Build Longene module


Build Wine
==========
To build Wine, cd to the top-level directory of the Wine for Longene
source (wine), then configure and build it:

  ./configure
  make
  make install


Build Longene module
=================================
To build the module, cd to the "module" directory and run
the command:

  make

After building, install the module to get the Longene running:

  insmod unifiedkernel.ko

All done, Longene is running!


Run programs
================

First, execute under cmdlind:

echo ':DOSWin:M::MZ::/usr/local/bin/wine:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

Now you can run some Win32 programs in X terminal windows just like what 
you do on Linux, such as:

  ./Hellworld.exe

Note that Longene is not completed yet, so some applications may crash the
system or not work properly as on Microsoft Windows. You can report these
bugs on :

  http://www.longene.org/bugzilla


UNINSTALL
=========
If you don't want to use Longene any more, you can uninstall it:

1. Uninstall module:
  
  rmmod unifiedkernel.ko

cd to the directory "module" and run command:
  
  make clean
